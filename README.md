Hanoi In English webapp
==============================

A social application made by, and made for, Hanoi In English members.

# Ideas

* No fun, no code
* Using git to manage, share and deploy codes
* Using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) to develop application in front-end
* Using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) to prototype and design application
* Using Python in back-end, as a playground for Hanoi In English Pythonics

# Development

## Get the code

   (TODO: more detail)
   For now, you just pull the code from this repository

## Dev environment

   Meetup requires 3rd party application to serve HTTPS, so you
   should make some configuration for your environment.

   * In a GNU/Linux based system, it's easy to create a self-signed cert and config a
     webserver working with it (Ex: Apache, nginx, ...)

   * In other systems such as Mac OS X and Windows, you may use WAMP/XAMP, there're
     many tutorials on the Internet which describe how to config them serving
     HTTPS.
